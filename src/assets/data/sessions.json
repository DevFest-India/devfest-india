The American Cancer Society estimates over 100,000 new melanoma cases will be diagnosed in 2020. It's also expected that almost 7,000 people will die from the disease. As with other cancers, early and accurate detection—potentially aided by data science—can make treatment more effective. TensorFlow is a fast, flexible, and scalable open-source machine learning library for research and production .TPUs, unlike GPUs, are custom-designed to handle operations like matrix multiplications in neural network training. In this workshop we will use TensorFlow APIs and TPU runtime accelerator to identify melanoma from Lesion Images in Kaggle .",
